# Hangman Game

## Overview
This is a simple Hangman Game developed in Java that allows players to guess letters of a hidden word within five chances. The game displays a visual representation of the hangman and progressively builds the drawing as wrong guesses are made. The project is a part of my Java-Development internship at CognoRise info tech.

## Features:
- **Random word generation**: The game selects a random word from a pre-defined list.
- **5 chances**: Players have up to five incorrect guesses before the game ends.
- **Hangman update**: The hangman drawing updates based on the player's progress.
- **User interaction**: Players can guess letters, see their progress, and are prompted to play again after winning or losing.
- **Replay option**: Option to replay the game after it ends.
- **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance and encapsulation are utilized to manage the game's logic and state.
- **Input Validation**: Performed input validations to insure seamless gameplay.
